This test script automates searching for products on Amazon India, fetching details (title and price), and navigating to product pages using Selenium WebDriver.

Test Scope:

Functionality tested:
Search for a product with a user-provided query
Extract title and price (if available) from search results for the first 3 products
Navigate to the product page for each of the first 3 products
Validate successful completion of each step
Functionality not tested:
Functionality beyond searching for laptops
Handling dynamic elements or layout changes on Amazon website
Robust error handling for all potential exceptions
Test Results:

Product Details Extraction:
Conditional Pass:
Script successfully extracted title and price for products with available data (individual results may vary).
Extraction failure cases were logged.
Navigate to Product Page:
Conditional Pass:
Script successfully clicked on the first 3 products and switched to their respective tabs if they opened correctly.
Tab switching failures were logged.
Overall Status:

The script demonstrates basic functionality for searching and fetching product details on Amazon. However, it requires further refinement for robustness and wider applicability.

Additional Notes:

The script includes time delays (sleep) for demonstration purposes. These may need adjustment based on network speed and website responsiveness.
Consider using more specific selectors for element identification to improve script reliability.
Extensive error handling for various exceptions is recommended for production use.
Next Steps:

Refine element identification methods to handle potential website layout changes.
Implement more comprehensive error handling for various exceptions.
Consider using libraries or techniques for dynamic element handling if needed.
Test the script with different search queries.
